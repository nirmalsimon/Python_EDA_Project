# Python_EDA_Project
Exciting Update on My Python Journey! üêç
I have been learning Python, leveraging my foundational knowledge of Java to adapt quickly to this powerful programming language. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of what I‚Äôve covered:

Core Concepts
Variables: Understanding how to store and manipulate data.
Strings: Working with text data and its various operations.
Loops: Implementing different types of loops for repetitive tasks.
Functions: Creating reusable blocks of code.
Conditional Statements: Using if conditions to control the flow of the program.
Data Structures: Exploring lists, tuples, and dictionaries, and their use cases.
Object-Oriented Programming
Delved into classes and objects, learning about inheritance and exception handling, and how to manage various types of errors without breaking the code.
Data Manipulation with NumPy
Explored basic operations and matrix operations, understanding their significance in data science.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Utilized libraries like pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and insight generation.
Project Overview
In my latest project, I employed a variety of data exploration techniques to detect errors. I also developed different functions for data cleaning, transformation, and insight generation. I utilized these functions with the apply function in DataFrames, which deepened my understanding of various inbuilt functions and how they operate. All the methods and reasoning behind my approach are thoroughly documented in a detailed PDF.

Repository Contents
